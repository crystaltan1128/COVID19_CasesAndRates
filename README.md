# Visualizing COVID-19 Effects in the United States
Crystal Tan

During the year 2020, the world changed drastically as the Covid-19 pandemic changed the way everyday people lived their lives. Countries shut down their doors in order to avoid continuous spread of this new illness. Now, in the year 2022, we are able to start living our lives as we did prior to the outbreak, however, the high number of cases and infections are still significant to us. It can be beneficial to look at these numbers for preventative measures in the future, and it may help us grasp what areas are more at risk. In these maps, using data from the New York Times, we are able to visualize how severe the case counts and rates were in the starting year of the pandemic prior to vaccinations. Using webmaps, the audience may interact with the map and gain more information about each county and how covid-19 has effected them. The first map will show the case rates within each county through a choropleth map while the second will show the cases by count through a proportional symbol map.
